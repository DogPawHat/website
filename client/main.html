            <p>Welcome to the coder forge.</p>
            <p>
              We hope to provide a place for adults to learn and trade as
              a `coder`. They are open to all, from complete newbies (noobs) to
              advanced programmers (guru's). There is no set curriculum and no costs
              either. Because of this these weekly meetups will be on an open door
              basis.
            </p>

            <p>
              These, workshops, or coder forges, are mimicked on the popular
              Coder Dojo for kids, with the exception of being for those 17yrs
              and up. Lessons will be thought using, predominantly, open source
              tools and from a DevOp methodology.
            </p>

            <p>
              Coder forges are to be stress free, without any set out curriculum,
              and they must also support and work with other open projects in
              their locality.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>based on open source methodologies and philosophies</li>
              <li>a community based structure where members can decide the
                direction and format of workshops</li>
              <li>an online portal for mentor and coder collaboration</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              As you can see this site is a work in progress, as is the project on a
              whole, but please do drop into our next meetup and see what it is all
              about.
